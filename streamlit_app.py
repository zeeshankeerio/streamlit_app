streamlit.text(''' I love to dig into data analytics problems, solve them with modern technologies, create new ideas, and translate business requirements into technical solutions. To accomplish this, I focus on delivering key outcomes, building possible analytical solutions, and quickly adapting to new learnings. 
I have enjoyed many machine learning, live data integration, prescriptive analytics, and business analytics problems throughout my career. My Freelancing and professional experiences have taught me the following about myself:
Multi tasking, working under pressure, performing data modeling, diagnostics on existing reports, developing data solutions, scaling, visualizing, transforming big-time series data, building ml models, and optimizing business problems that matter. 
I educate, refine and drive myself to be a better person, staying calm when faced with adversity, I am constantly learning because I never settle, focusing on making high-quality decisions & experienced in learning and excelling at new technologies as needed.
I enjoy meeting new people, and I do not like pushy people. If you are nice, I will go out of my way to help you. I like to treat people with respect, and I love to learn about new technologies and hear new perspectives. Reach out if you want to talk to me about emerging tech, solving data analytics, machine learning problems, or consultation.''')
